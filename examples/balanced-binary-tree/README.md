## Balanced Binary Tree

The isBalanced function determines if a binary tree with root root is balanced or not. A binary tree is balanced if the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one.

The function starts by handling the case when the root itself is null, returning true since an empty tree is considered balanced. For non-empty trees, the function uses a recursive helper function to compute the height of each subtree. The height of each subtree is the maximum height between its left and right subtrees plus one (since the height is counted by the number of edges).

The helper function calculates the height of each subtree, and at each step, it checks if the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is greater than one. If such a difference is found, it sets the flag variable to false, indicating that the tree is not balanced.

After recursively computing the height of the entire tree, the flag variable is returned, which will be true if the tree is balanced and false otherwise.
